            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For if any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been the Author of the Scripture, he muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evill: It was

Therefore (good Lord) we are compell'd to believe and confeſſe, that the holy Bible is thy Book, and not the work of any creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Becauſe thoſe things which are written in many places of the holy Bible are written in ſuch a lofty ſtile, with ſuch an extraordinary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170541:16"/> phraſe, and with ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural matters, as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the capacity and nature of men wholly; yea, beyond all humane knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that it is impoſſible for men to conceive or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſuch words, much leſſe to know or to write them of themſelves, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of an all-wiſe God. For ſuch words, as are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Bible, could never be underſtood, thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſo much as once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by the wit of man, much leſſe laid down in writing. For what man was able to write, conceive, or imagine of that inſcrutable myſtery in the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; namely, that there be three Perſons in one God-head,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170541:17"/> really diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and yet theſe three to be coequal in dignity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall in nature, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternall in being; yea, all three Perſons to be one and the ſame ſimple and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, without body, parts or paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Who could i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that power to be three diſtinct perſons which is the ſame in ſubſtance, in eſſence, in number, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Deity? ſurely fleſh and blood could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal theſe things to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> nor to any other man. A man might conceive perhaps as ſome Philoſophers have done, That God is One, Simple, and Indiviſible, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170541:17"/> that this one God ſhould be three diſtinct perſons, equal in all things, is above mans reach: Therefore he that cauſed this to be revealed and written, was no leſſe than a God that knoweth all things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What man of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> himſelf durſt once ſay, or affirm, yea, or imagine, that God was made man? That the Word was made Fleſh? That the Deity aſſumed the humanity? And the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto the Deity in one perſon united? So that both Deity and humanity are and remain in one and the ſame perſon without confuſion of natures, ſo that one Chriſt is both God and man? And this myſtery done in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in Trinity, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170541:18"/> not in the Firſt or the Third? Could this be the invention of any man's braine? Could any deep ſighted Philoſopher either produce the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Nature, or invent the ſame in reaſon? can any carping Atheiſt, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt &amp; ſharpeſt, conceive or imagine of himſelf how this ſhould be? therefore the Bible is the wiſedom &amp; writing of God and not of men. For if we ſhould admit that men might know that it was needfull that God ſhould be united unto our man-hood (though none of themſelves could be ſo wiſe) yet who was able to ſay that it ſhold be ſo, when it ſhould be, how, in what place, and by what means? ſurely no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither good nor bad
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170541:18"/> could imagine of himſelfe. An evill creature eſpecially could neither ſay nor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it of himſelf, becauſe it was a matter tending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chiefeſt good, and to the higheſt exaltation and greateſt dignity of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For now our nature in the perſon of Chriſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all the Angells in heaven; and therefore an evill creature could never imagine or think of ſo good and ſo great a benefit: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of himſelf or his own wiſedome ſpeak of theſe things;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.</note> becauſe no creature was able to know theſe things of himſelf.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.</note> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither a good nor a bad creature could write theſe of themſelves, then it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170541:19"/> muſt be that the Creator of all wrote them; or if at leaſt wiſe ſome good men wrote them, yet they firſt received them of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, To adde more proof to this, How could any man be ever able to write or to imagine, that a young Virgin ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive without a man? and bring forth a man, and yet remain a pure Virgin both before and after? What man durſt either ſay or affirm ſuch a thing for a truth, it being the contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Therefore (good Lord) as it was thy holy arm that wrought it, ſo was it thy wiſedom that revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, and cauſed it to be written.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:170541:19"/>
               <p>Fifthly, To ſeal up all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> What man was able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to write of the begining of the world, when it was made, in how many dayes, what were done in every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall day? That man was made laſt? For if he was made laſt of all creatures, how could he have written either when himſelfe was made, or what things were made when he had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? (except thou Lord hadſt taught and inſtructed him how &amp; what to write) Was <hi>Adam</hi> able of himſelfe to know that that was the ſixt day wherein he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, except thou Lord hadſt taught him.

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170541:20"/> and how many Cubits the waters did prevail above all Mountains, ſeeing <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were in the Arke? Could he meaſure it wh t height it was by Cubits, if thou (Lord) hadſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him? Or, who could be ſo bold, ſo fond, ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and ſo voyd of ſenſe and reaſon as to write, That ſo huge, ſo firm, and ſo faire a building as this world is, ſhall be conſumed with fire in a moment, and that ſo ſuddenly the Elements ſhould be diſſolved and melt with heat, and that the very ſame bodies of men that are now conſumed to duſt and aſhes ſhould riſe again in the twinckling of an eye? could any man know, or imagine theſe things, much leſs write
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170541:20"/> of them, but onely the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power that hath made and created them? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore (my Lord and maker) the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have ſuch Authority, ſuch threatnings, ſuch eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall promiſes, ſuch lofty ſtyle, ſuch extraordinary phraſes, ſuch ſupernaturall matters, ſo farre out of all creatures knowledge, ſo ſtrange unto all mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and ſo far above their imagination; Laſtly, ſeeing all other Books of the ſame ſubject are found to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, &amp; the authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diſagreeing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo many wayes; And ſeeing the holy Scriptures could never be branded with errours, or juſtly charged with enlargement in any

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170541:46"/> the ſubſtance and originall of our corruptible bodies from our earthly Fathers, ſo have we our ſoules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, who is our heavenly Father: ſo that God by creation is the Father of us all, and we his ſonnes; and as all thoſe are termed brethren which receive their bodies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from one man; ſo may all thoſe be well called brethren, that receive their ſpirit, life and ſoul from one God: So that God both by Creation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is the Father of us all, and all of us are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: and look how much the ſoule doth excell the body, ſo much the more farre, doth our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excell our earthly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170541:47"/> and ſo much doth our fraternity in God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell our brotherhood in man. For without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon God is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be termed a Father in reſpect of the ſoul, than a carnall Father is in reſpect of the body, becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in compariſon of the ſoul is as nothing. For a man is a man in reſpect of his ſoul, and the body hath his being onely for the ſoul; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect therefore that the ſoul is the chief thing in man, it is evident that God from whom it cometh, is the chief Father. So that every man is more the ſon of God than he is the ſon of his carnall Father, becauſe he receiveth this principall part immediately from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170541:47"/> God. Nay, which is more, man receiveth from his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father but ſome part of his body, for he receiveth part from his mother; yea, both his Father and Mother are but the inſtrumentall cauſe in generation, for God is the principal in the generation of the body, and the onely and ſole cauſe of the ſoul; for man receiveth his ſoul onely from God, not in part, as his body from his carnal Father, but wholely and entirely. Now therefore ſeeing we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſons more in reſpect of our ſoules than in reſpect of our bodies, it followeth that we are brethren in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſoul, more than in reſpect of the body; for in reſpect of the body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

If Chriſt then were not the Meſſias, it ſhould happen that God by ſuffering him ſhould hinder himſelf, and be againſt himſelf, and his own Kingdome, becauſe he diſpoſed his people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in ſuch a one as Chriſt is. For it muſt needs be that he which God ſends for a Saviour, ſhould do as Chriſt Jeſus did, affirming himſelf to be true God and man, deſtroying and impugning all ſins, and this cannot be done: For if God ſhould ſend another that ſhould do as Chriſt did, and ſay as he ſaid, then he ſhould in all things agree with Chriſt;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170541:51"/> his Doctrine with Jeſus's Doctrine, his works with Chriſts works, for greater works cannot be, but this cannot be, for then more than one could be the Son of God, the Meſſias, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and Gods anointed, which muſt be anointed with the oyl of gladneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his fellowes: But if there ſhould be more than one, then the Saviour muſt have an equall, but Chriſt hath no fellow: For he is the Arch-angel and chief Meſſenger of all.

For in our firſt generation <hi>Adam</hi> was the head; but in

In our firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting <hi>Adam</hi> was eſpouſed to <hi>Eve,</hi> but in our laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting every Chriſtian is eſpouſed to Chriſt.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170541:57"/> For whereſoever this third kind of brotherhood is not, there all the reſt are dead in deed; for this is the frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of grace, and the reſt but of nature; and betwixt grace and nature, I mean, between our being in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and our being in grace, there is no ſmall difference: For there is great difference between our ſimply being, and our holineſs of being. For it is one thing to be, &amp; another thing to be well, holy, and godly, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and forme of our being, for being may be without the holineſſe thereof.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170541:57"/> do impart unto the reſt of the members whatſoever they have; for the liver gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all blood and groſſe humors unto the members, of which the member<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond part in a mans body is the heart, and it ſendeth naturall heat unto all the members, with vitall being; and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from the heart to the members by the arteries; and the heart giving this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall heat is like unto God, that giveth the living ſoul to the body: for as the ſoul
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170541:58"/> doth quicken the body, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo doth the heart give vital heat to the members, for without this naturall heat the members were dead; The head, which is above all, contayning the brain in it, doth by the nerves give unto all the members both ſenſe and motion; this head is like Chriſt, which giveth all ſenſe and motion of grace unto us his members. Therefore, as the members of our bodies receive blood from the liver, life from the heart, and ſenſe and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the head; ſo, we receive firſt our fleſh from man, our ſoul from God, and all motion and ſenſe of grace from Chriſt, both God and man. Whatſoever the liver &amp; the heart doth give
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170541:58"/> to us, it is for the being of our bodies; but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head giveth to our bodies, it is for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and well-being of the members. So that when a member in our bodies looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſenſe and motion, it looſeth then his perfection and well-being; though it looſeth not his being which it receiveth from the liver and the heart: So that we ſee, that a member may loſe his well-being and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though not his being ſimply. As for example, that member that is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a dead palſie, hath loſt his well-being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, namely, ſenſe and motion which is receiveth from the brain. By this, Lord, I ſee thy mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170541:59"/> thy enemies; for though they receive not the ſenſe &amp; motion of grace from Chriſt, as from their head, yet they ſtill receive their influence from God, becauſe they are preſerved in their being, as touching their ſoul. For, having no life of grace, they have from God the life of nature by the ſoul; and as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fleſh and body, they receive the benefit of creatures, namely, a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their being.</p>
               <p>O Lord, if thou doeſt ſo much for ſuch as have no life nor motion from Chriſt; what wilt thou do to ſuch as live in Chriſt? Lord, thou art full of wiſdom, and haſt given us theſe three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts, that we might
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170541:59"/> think of our threefold ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For when we think of our liver, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth blood and ſubſtance to our members; it putteth us in minde that we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our fleſh from man: when we think of our heart which giveth vitall and naturall heat to our members, it puts us in mind that we received our Soul from the living God. Laſtly, when we think of our head that giveth ſenſe and motion to our bodies, it maketh us remember, how that we receive in our laſt generation all ſenſe and motion of grace from our head Chriſt. And calling this to minde, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is a threefold brother
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170541:60"/> unto us: Firſt, by man, as having all of us our fleſh from one and the ſame man <hi>Adam.</hi> Secondly, by God, as having all our ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into our bodies, by one and the ſelf ſame God. And thirdly, by our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as having all of us that be Chriſtians received all grace and good motions from one and the ſame Chriſt, God and man. Therfore, we ought to love all as brethren in the fleſh; but love them the more as brethren in Soul; but love them beſt of all that are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in grace unto us; for whoſoever is our brother in grace, muſt needs be our brother in ſoul and body likewiſe: And therefore a Chriſtian is no half brother or baſe bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>COurtiers, deſirous by following Prince's Court to benefit themſelves and to raiſe their houſe for them and their poſterity, ought to be carefull to know the right way by which they may be exalted, being but earthly men, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are but four ways ordinarily whereby all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy things here below may be promoted; firſt, By art, at the water that of it ſelf is heavy, and by nature runs downward, is by skil and knowledge not onely drawn up as high as the fountain from whence it
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170541:139"/> firſt ſprang, but far higher. Secondly, by nature's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe in things here below, as in trees and plants, whoſe tops do mount up ſo much the higher above the earth, by how much their roots are lower and deeper in the earth. Thirdly, by vertue &amp; power of the celeſtial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as thoſe vapours that are exhaled up by force and vertue of the Sun-beames. Laſtly, by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence uſed here below to drive things upward, as when an arrow is ſhot up from a ſtrong bow, a ſtone from a ſling, or a bullet from a piece; by which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence things ſuddenly mount up, but doe as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall again. In like
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170541:140"/> manner are men exalted here upon earth: Some by art, learning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry exalt themſelves and their houſes, not onely as high as the fountain of their bloud &amp; linaege, but far above them as <hi>Moſes, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> &amp;c. have done: ſome again by their humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God and their Prince do root themſelves to low in the earth, that their fair boughes and branches of their name and poſterity grow extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in height above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by reaſon of their ſure and ſound root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continue longer before they either fall or decay; And ſo did Chriſt and his Apoſtles exalt themſelves: ſome like the vapours are
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170541:140"/> immediately drawn up on high by the celeſtiall power and pleaſure of God, by his extraordinary mercies to try them, as <hi>Lucifer, Saul Herod, Nabuchadnezzar &amp;c.</hi> who, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170541:141"/> ſoon fall fearfully, as <hi>Saul, Balthaſar, Haman, Herod, Gehezi,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did.</p>

                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:170541:194"/> that ſpake both Aſhdod and Hebrew.
